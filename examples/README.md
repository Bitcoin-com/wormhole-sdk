This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how
to code up common use cases for a Wormhole wallet and managing tokens.

## Installation

Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the parent directory.

## Running Examples

You can run each example script by entering its directory and executing `npm start`

## General BCH Functions

- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a Wormhole compatible HD Node wallet on
  the BCH testnet. Send test BCH using a testnet faucet (like
  [this one](https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/bitcoin-cash-faucet),
  [this one](http://www.wormhole.cash/test/), or
  [this one](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/bch-testnet/))
  to the address saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app.

- [check-balance](check-balance) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This
  displays both BCH information as well as Wormhole token information.

- [send-bch](send-bch) Send BCH to another address. (*Great for sending balances
  back to the testnet faucet.*)

- [token-info-from-tx](data-retrieval/token-info-from-tx) Most examples in this
  directory output a TXID. Once the transaction has been stored to the blockchain
  (one confirmation), you can retrieve information on the token using this TXID.
  This is particularly useful for discovering the `propertyId` assigned to a managed
  token or getting information on a crowd-sale token.

## Wormhole Token Functions

These example apps roughly follow the
[third Wormhole tutorial](https://developer.bitcoin.com/tutorials/wormhole-3-tokens.html)

- [ping-wh-node](ping-wh-node) Ping the Wormhole node to ensure all networking
  between you and the node is functioning correctly.

- [burn-bch](burn-bch) **NOT WORKING**
  Burn 1 BCH to generate 100 WHC tokens. These WHC tokens
  are needed to creating your own tokens. You'll need to wait for 1 confirmation
  before seeing the WHC tokens in your account.

- [lookup-token](lookup-token) Lookup token information based on the `primaryid`
  value assigned to it.

- [send-tokens](send-tokens) Send existing tokens or WHC tokens to another address.

- [list-all-tokens](list-all-tokens) List every token in existence.

### Managed Tokens

Managed tokens all new tokens to be created at any time. And existing tokens can
be revoked.

- [create-managed-token](create-managed-token) Create a managed token.

- [managed-token-info-from-tx](managed-token-info-from-tx) Lookup token information based on a
  TXID generated from `managed-token`. This example will retrieve the `primaryid`
  value needed to issue new tokens.

- [issue-managed-tokens](issue-managed-tokens) Issue new tokens and send them to the address
  generated by `create-wallet`. You'll need to wait for 1 confirmation
  before seeing the new tokens with `token-balance`.

- [change-managed-token-issuer](change-managed-token-issuer) Change the address
  capable of issuing new tokens.

- [list-issuances](list-issuances) List the issuance transactions.

- [revoke-managed-tokens](revoke-managed-tokens) Revoke existing tokens.

### Fixed Tokens

Fixed tokens are created with fixed supply.

- [create-fixed-token](create-fixed-token)
- [fixed-token-info-from-tx](fixed-token-info-from-tx)

### Crowd Sale

- [create-crowdsale](create-crowdsale)
- [participate-in-crowdsale](participate-in-crowdsale)
- [close-crowdsale](close-crowdsale)
