This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how
to code up common use cases for a Wormhole wallet and managing tokens.

## General BCH Functions

- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a Wormhole compatible HD Node wallet on
  the BCH testnet. Send test BCH using a
  [testnet faucet](https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/bitcoin-cash-faucet) to
  the address saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app.

- [check-balance](check-balance) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This displays
  only BCH information, not any token information.

- [send-bch](send-bch) Send BCH to another address. (Great for sending balances
  back to the testnet faucet.)
