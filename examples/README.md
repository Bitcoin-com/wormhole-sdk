This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how
to code up common use cases for a Wormhole wallet and managing tokens.

## Installation

Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the parent directory.

## Running Examples

You can run each example script by entering its directory and executing `npm start`

## General BCH Functions

- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a Wormhole compatible HD Node wallet on
  the BCH testnet. Send test BCH using a testnet faucet (like
  [this one](https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/bitcoin-cash-faucet) or
  [this one](http://www.wormhole.cash/test/))
  to the address saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app.

- [check-balance](check-balance) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This displays
  only BCH information, not any token information.

- [send-bch](send-bch) Send BCH to another address. (Great for sending balances
  back to the testnet faucet.)

## Wormhole Token Functions

- [ping-wh-node](ping-wh-node) Ping the Wormhole node to ensure all networking
  between you and the node is functioning correctly.

- [burn-bch](burn-bch) **NOT WORKING**
  Burn 1 BCH to generate 100 WHC tokens. These WHC tokens
  are needed to creating your own tokens. You'll need to wait for 1 confirmation
  before seeing the WHC tokens in your account.

- [token-balance](token-balance) Check the balance of WHC and other tokens for
  a given address.

- [managed-token](managed-token) Create a managed token.

- [token-info-from-tx](token-info-from-tx) Lookup token information based on a
  TXID generated from `managed-token`. This example will retrieve the `primaryid`
  value needed to issue new tokens.

- [lookup-token](lookup-token) Lookup token information based on the `primaryid`
  value assigned to it.

- [issue-tokens](issue-tokens) Issue new tokens and send them to the address
  generated by `create-wallet`. You'll need to wait for 1 confirmation
  before seeing the new tokens with `token-balance`.

* [send-token](send-token) Send generated tokens or WHC tokens.
