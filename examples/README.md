This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how
to code up common use cases for a Wormhole wallet and managing tokens.

## General BCH Functions

- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a Wormhole compatible HD Node wallet on
  the BCH testnet. Send test BCH using a testnet faucet (like
  [this one](https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/bitcoin-cash-faucet) or
  [this one](http://www.wormhole.cash/test/))
  to the address saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app.

- [check-balance](check-balance) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This displays
  only BCH information, not any token information.

- [send-bch](send-bch) Send BCH to another address. (Great for sending balances
  back to the testnet faucet.)

## Wormhole Token Functions

- [ping-wh-node](ping-wh-node) Ping the Wormhole node to ensure all networking
  between you and the node is functioning correctly.

- [send-token](send-token) Send generated tokens or WHC tokens.

- [managed-token](managed-token) Create a managed token.
