This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how
to code up common use cases for a Wormhole wallet and managing tokens.

## PR Notes _(will be removed)_

Some setup is required to run the code in this PR.

- Because of
  [Issue 7](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/wormholecash/issues/7) this PR also
  includes the code in [PR 8](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/wormholecash/pull/8).

- A local wormhole node is used because `trest.bitcoin.com` does not yet support
  Wormhole rest calls.

- Beyond providing examples of how to use the SDK, these examples provide a solid
  foundation for creating end-to-end tests to ensure things like the NPM library
  doesn't break, or that `trest.bitcoin.com` is up and functioning correctly.

## Installation

Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the parent directory.

## Running Examples

You can run each example script by entering its directory and executing `npm start`

## General BCH Functions

- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a Wormhole compatible HD Node wallet on
  the BCH testnet. Send test BCH using a testnet faucet (like
  [this one](https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/bitcoin-cash-faucet) or
  [this one](http://www.wormhole.cash/test/))
  to the address saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app.

- [check-balance](check-balance) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This displays
  only BCH information, not any token information.

- [send-bch](send-bch) Send BCH to another address. (Great for sending balances
  back to the testnet faucet.)

## Wormhole Token Functions

- [ping-wh-node](ping-wh-node) Ping the Wormhole node to ensure all networking
  between you and the node is functioning correctly.

- [burn-bch](burn-bch) **NOT WORKING**
  Burn 1 BCH to generate 100 WHC tokens. These WHC tokens
  are needed to creating your own tokens.

- [token-balance](token-balance) Check the balance of WHC and other tokens for
  a given address.

- [managed-token](managed-token) Create a managed token.

- [send-token](send-token) Send generated tokens or WHC tokens.
